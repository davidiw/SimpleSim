Introduction
=============
I had trouble finding a P2P simulator / graphing utility that was efficient and
could be compiled on modern C; furthermore, my C skills have never really been
tested.  This led to my development of simplesim, a multipurpose overlay simulator
that can easily scale to millions of nodes and potentially 10s of millions
given the right resources.  Perhaps, I'll make it capable of running on
multiple machines so that memory is not a consideration.  As it stands now, I
suspect the upper bound will be somewhere around 10 million on a 4 GB machine.

Requirements
=============
Some unix variant with gcc and make

Compile
========
"mkdir build" and then execute "make" in the root directory

Run
====
cd build && ./sim
or
Execute "make run" in the root directory

Tests
======
"mkdir build" and then execute "make test" in the root directory


Obviously my make-fu needs to improve...
