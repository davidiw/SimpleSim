Introduction
=============
I had trouble finding a P2P simulator / graphing utility that was efficient and
could be compiled on modern C; furthermore, my C skills have never really been
tested.  This led to my development of simplesim, a multipurpose overlay simulator
that can easily scale to millions of nodes given the right resources.  Perhaps,
I'll make it capable of running on multiple machines so that memory is not a
consideration.

Requirements
=============
Some unix variant with gcc and make

Compile
========
execute "make" in the root directory

Run
====
make && ./sim
or
make run
check ./sim --help for input parameters

Tests
======
make test && ./test
or
make run_test
